OnTime is a comprehensive reminder application project implemented using modern iOS development practices. This project is structured around the VIPER architecture pattern and showcases several best practices, such as SOLID principles, Protocol-Oriented Programming, and more.



# Project Structure

OnTime uses a hierarchical directory structure, divided into various categories such as `Common`, `Modules`, `Theme`, `Tests`, and more.

## Features

### SOLID Principles

The project extensively uses SOLID principles which are a set of guidelines in object-oriented programming design. They help developers write more understandable, flexible, and maintainable code.

### VIPER Architecture

VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router) is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS projects. It is used in this project to maintain a clean and organized structure and to create a better separation of concerns, with easy-to-understand roles.

### SwiftUI

SwiftUI is used for declarative UI development in this project.

### Combine

The Combine framework is used in this project for handling asynchronous events over time, simplifying the work with asynchronous code.

### CoreData

CoreData is used in this project for persistent data storage, allowing the app to efficiently store, cache, and retrieve data.

### Protocol-Based Network Abstraction Layer

The project uses protocol-based abstraction layers in the networking component. This approach provides several benefits such as improved testability, better separation of concerns, and easier changes in the networking layer.

### Unit Testing

The project includes both unit tests and UI tests to ensure functionality correctness, using the XCTest framework.

## Modules

The `Modules` directory contains various components of the VIPER architecture for different features of the app, including `OnTimeListScreen` and `OnTimeDetailsScreen`. 

## Theme

The `Theme` directory contains all of the design-related components such as colors, fonts, and any other styling related files.

## Tests

The `Tests` directory contains unit tests and UI tests to ensure the correctness of the app's functionality.

## Common

The `Common` directory houses shared components like AppConstants, CoreData related files, models, network services, utilities, etc.

## Future Improvement

There is always room for improvement; in future versions of the application, we are planning to add more features and use the latest technologies and architectures to keep the application robust and maintainable. Contributions are always welcome!

## Conclusion

OnTime is a robust, scalable, and maintainable application, thanks to the SOLID principles, VIPER architecture, and other best practices used. It provides a great starting point for anyone looking to understand or build on these principles and concepts.
